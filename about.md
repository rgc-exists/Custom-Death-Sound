# Custom Death Sound
A mod for changing the death sound effect, but with extra features.

# Features
- A custom death sound (file types: .ogg, .wav, .mp3, .flac)
- Volume customization
- Pitch randomization
- MULTIPLE custom death sounds from a directory (randomly picked each death.)

# Planned features
In the future, I'd like to add an option to make it so the sound keeps playing after the level resets. As of now from a technical standpoint I'm stumped on how to do it. Pull requests are welcome!
