# Custom Death Sound
A mod for changing the death sound effect (AND level complete sound), but with extra features.

# Features
- A custom death sound (file types: .ogg, .wav, .mp3, .flac)
- MULTIPLE custom death sounds from a directory (randomly picked each death.)
- A custom LEVEL COMPLETE sound effect
- Volume customization
- Pitch randomization
- Mute the death sound
- Mute the level complete sound
- Make the death sound NOT clear after the level resets

## Lack of iOS Support
No iOS support is planned since as far as I can tell you can't play a sound from the iOS file system, sorry. :(  
If anyone can find an alternative to this, feel free to make a pull request!
